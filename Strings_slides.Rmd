# Outline  

* Review of joins 

* Strings  

* Regular expressions

---

# Six kinds of joins  

Mutating joins:  

* Inner, Left, Right, Full  

Filtering joins:  

* Anti-join, Semi-join

# Questions for Soccer Joins  

Thought experiment: For these two tables, think about what tibble would be produced by each of the 6 joins.  Draw the tible you expect to be produced and answer the following?

1) How many rows and columns?

--

2) Which rows are included/excluded?

--

3) Are NA values produced by join? Where?

--

4) Which columns are included/excluded?

---

# Reflection  

1) Compare/contrast the joins. Think of situations where you might prefer one over the other.

--

2) The filtering join `semi_join()` is most similar to which of the mutating joins? Why?

# No, really! What is a string?


---

## What are strings and why do we care about them?  

* Untidy data may contain problematic strings, hidden characters

--

* Scraping from web sources often requires locating, removing  or replacing strings

### Detecting Strings Using **stringr** `str_()` Functions

```{r, echo = FALSE}
states <- c("California", "Florida", "Louisiana", "Texas", "Michigan", 
"Minnesota", "Georgia", "Arizona", "Indiana", "New Jersey")
```

Detect text in a vector of the states that have hosted the super bowl:  
```{r}
states
```

---

## `str_detect()`

```{r}
str_detect(states, "ana")
str_detect(states, "ANA")
```

---

## `str_replace()` 

.scroll-box-16[
```{r}
str_replace(states, "ana", "X")
str_replace_all(states, "i", "X")
```
]
---

## `str_sub()` and `str_count()` 

```{r}
str_sub(states, 2, 4)
str_count(states, "e")
```

and many more...

## Regular expressions to the rescue!


---
## Regular Expressions 

* Regular expressions or *regexps* concisely describe patterns in strings  

* They are powerful but can also be cryptic and confusing  

* Using just the right *regexp* can   

    + save lots of time and effort cleaning data  
    
    + help to tame very messy data
    
* You don't need to know everything!  

* Try the resources on Moodle

---
### Using str_view() to verify regexps

```{r}
#starts with M or L
str_detect(states, "^[ML]")
str_view(states, "^[ML]")
```
