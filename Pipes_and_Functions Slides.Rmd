##  The Tidyverse Pipe  

![](figures/magrittr_pipe.jpeg)

---

## Why we need the pipe?  Violent rabbits??  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```

Stringing commands without the pipe leads to:

* Code cluttered with unimportant names  
    + But it's not about the use of memory  
* Need to keep track of object versions  
    + Sequential numbering like `lakers2`?  

---

## Overwriting names is problematic 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo <- scoop(foo_foo, up = field_mice)
foo_foo <- bop(foo_foo, on = head)
```

* Need to rerun from the top when debugging  

* Code is hard to follow due to repetition    
    + What's changing each time?  

---
## Using the pipe! %>% 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head) -> 
  the_output  
```

* Easy to follow  
* Focuses on actions  
* Avoids clutter and repitition  

---
## The Hadley-approved Version 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Easy to comment out the first line when debugging
the_output<- 
  foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

* Easy to follow  
* Focuses on actions  
* Avoids clutter and repitition  

---
## When to avoid the pipe?  

* Many steps that cannot be condensed further.   

* Multiple inputs/outputs (but you might want to learn about the tee "%T>%")

* Non-linear process

# Functions  

---
## From Calculus  

* A function is a rule  

* For every input we can only get one output  

* Passes vertical line test  

```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 4, warning = FALSE}
x <- seq(-2, 6, .05)
y <- x^3 - 6*x^2 + 4*x + 12
plot(x, y, 
     type="l", 
     xaxt='n', yaxt='n', 
     bty='n', 
     xlab='', ylab='', 
     col="blue")
##  Next add in your axis arrows:
arrows(min(x), 0, max(x), 0, lwd=1, length=0.15)
arrows(0, min(y), 0, max(y), lwd=1, length=0.15)
##  And plot your x/y labels.  Note that if you want them
##    actually at the end of the arrows you would need to 
##    remove the pos= argument and shorten your arrows by
##    a small amount.  To match your original figure, you can
##    alter the x/y coordinate to be the max() instead.
text(0, max(y), "f(x)", pos=2)
text(max(x), 0, "x", pos=3)
#axis(1)
#axis(2)
```

## Functions in Computer Science

```{r, out.width = '30%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Function_machine2.svg.png')
```


---
## Why Functions?  

```{r}
#  x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 
(-(-5) +c(-1,1)*sqrt((-5)^2 - 4*1*(-14)))/( 2*1) 
```

```{r}
# 2x^2 + 2x − 12 = 0
(-(2) +c(-1,1)*sqrt((2)^2 - 4*(2)*(-12)))/( 2*2) 
```

```{r}
#  x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 
(-(-4) +c(-1,1)*sqrt((-4)^2 - 4*1*(4)))/( 2*1) 
```


---

## Write a Famous Function

```{r}
quad_roots <- function(aval, bval, cval){
  (-bval +c(-1,1)*sqrt(bval^2 - 4*aval*cval))/( 2*aval) 
}
quad_roots(1, -5, -14)  
quad_roots(2, 2, -12)  
quad_roots(1, -4, 4)  # Gives repeated roots
```

# Functions and Automation

## A Quick Exercise: Popular TV shows

RStudio Cloud $\rightarrow$ Web scraping + automation

1. Scrape the list of most popular TV shows on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter  

2. Click through on each of the *first three* (or however many you can get through) tv show detail pages to also obtain genres and runtime.  

3. Time permitting, also try to get the following:  
    + Number of episodes so far  
    + Certificate (PG, PG-13, etc.)  
    + First five plot keywords  
    + Country  
    + Language
  
4. Add this information to the data frame you created in step 1 and tidy up.

# Functions to the Rescue

---

## Start at the Beginning

Read and save data for the top 3 TV shows:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

wanda <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140560/")
sinner <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6048596/")
behind <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698442/")
```

---
## Why functions?

Automate common tasks in a power powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:  

* Use names that indicate what the purpose of the function
    + Avoid reserved R names: like `c`, `sum`  
    
* Make updating code easier allowing you to update in just one place instead of many  

* Eliminate mistakes with copying and pasting  
    + Forgetting to make corresponding changes in all places  
    
* Learn to write and share your own functions!  
---


## When to consider writing a function? 

"...whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice" [R4DS]

---
### When to consider writing a function? 

*  Do you see any problems in the code below?  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wanda_episode <- wanda %>%
  html_nodes(".np_right_arrow .bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  parse_number()

sinner_episode <- sinner %>%
  html_nodes(".np_right_arrow .bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  parse_number()

behind_episode <- behind %>%
  html_nodes(".np_right_arrow .bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  parse_number()
```


---

## Inputs
How many inputs does the following code have?

```{r eval=FALSE}
wanda_episode <- wanda %>%
  html_nodes(".np_right_arrow .bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  parse_number()
```
---
## Turn your code into a function

*  Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.  

*  List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function()`.  
    + With more than one input, we would have  `function(x, y, z)`.



```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_episode <- function(x){  #<<
  
  
  
  
  
}  
```

---

## Turn your code into a function

*  Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.  

*  List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function()`.  
    + With more than one input, we would have  `function(x, y, z)`.

* Place the **code** you have developed in body of the function, a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.  

```{r}
scrape_episode <- function(x){
  x %>%                                                    #<<
    html_nodes(".np_right_arrow .bp_sub_heading") %>%      #<<
    html_text() %>%     #<<
    str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%    #<<
    parse_number()   #<<
}
```
---
## What do we get when we run it?  

```{r}
scrape_episode(wanda)
```

---
## Check your function

```{r, out.height = '10%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/episode_wanda.png')
```

```{r}
scrape_episode(wanda)
```

```{r, out.height = '10%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/episode_sinner.png')
```

```{r}
scrape_episode(sinner)
```

---
## Check your function

```{r, out.height = '10%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/episode_behind.png')
```

```{r}
scrape_episode(behind)
```

---
## Naming functions

* Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

* Names should be verbs, not nouns

* Multi-word names should be separated by underscores  
    + `snake_case` as opposed to `camelCase`

*  A family of functions should be named similarly 
    + `scrape_title`, `scrape_episode`, `scrape_genre`, etc.
---
## Scraping show info

```{r}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){

  title <- x %>% #<<
    html_node("#title-overview-widget h1") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()

  runtime <- x %>% #<<
    html_node("#titleDetails time") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_replace("\\n", "") %>%
    str_replace("min", "") %>%
    str_trim()
  
  genres <- x %>% #<<
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim() %>%
    paste(collapse = ", ")
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres) #<<
}
```
---
## Using our function

```{r}
scrape_show_info(wanda)
scrape_show_info(sinner)
scrape_show_info(behind)
```

---

## Toward a still more powerful function

How would you update the following function to use the URL of the page as an argument?

.scroll-box-20[
```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){

  title <- x %>%
    html_node("#title-overview-widget h1") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()

  runtime <- x %>%
    html_node("#titleDetails time") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_replace("\\n", "") %>%
    str_replace("min", "") %>%
    str_trim()
  
  genres <- x %>%
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim() %>%
    paste(collapse = ", ")
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres)
}
```
]

---


.scroll-output[
```{r}

scrape_show_info <- function(x){

    y <- read_html(x) #<<

    
    title <- y %>%
    html_node("#title-overview-widget h1") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()

  runtime <- y %>%
    html_node("#titleDetails time") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_replace("\\n", "") %>%
    str_replace("min", "") %>%
    str_trim()
  
  genres <- y %>%
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim() %>%
    paste(collapse = ", ")
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres)
}
```
]

---

## Let's check

```{r}
wanda_url <- "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140560/"
sinner_url <- "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6048596/"
behind_url <- "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt9698442/"

```

---

## Let's check

```{r}
scrape_show_info(wanda_url)
scrape_show_info(sinner_url)
scrape_show_info(behind_url)
```

---

## Automation?  

* We now have a function for scraping TV show info given URL  

* Where can we get a list of URLS ot top 100 TV shows on IMDB?  

* Your turn: Write the code that will do this!  
    + Hint: You'll need the `paste()` function to construct the URL

---

.scroll-output[
```{r}
urls <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter") %>%
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a") %>%
  html_attr("href") %>%
  paste("http://www.imdb.com", ., sep = "") %>%
  str_extract(".*tt[0-9]{7,8}")  
head(urls)
```
]


---
### Go to each page, scrape show info 

* Now we need a way to tell R to go to each page on the `urls` list and run the `scrape_show_info()` function on that page.

.scroll-box-20[
```{r}
# This could get a bit much!
scrape_show_info(urls[1])
scrape_show_info(urls[2])
scrape_show_info(urls[3])
```
]

---
class: inverse, center, top

background-image: url(figures/purrr.png)
background-position: 50% 75%
background-size: 50% 50%

## We have the `purrr`fect solution!  


---

## Go to each page, scrape show info 

In other words, we want to **map** the `scrape_show_info` function to each element of `show_urls`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
top_100_shows <- map_df(urls, scrape_show_info)
top_100_shows
```

* Visits `urls` one after another and scrapes the info.  

* `map_df` outputs a data frame (tibble) by binding rows together

---

## Caution  

* If you get `HTTP Error 429 (Too many requests)` you might want to slow down your hits.

* You can add a `Sys.sleep()` call to slow down your function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){
  Sys.sleep(runif(1))  #<<
  ...

}
```

---
# Your turn

### Can you create a similar function to access information on the Top Rated TV Shows on IMDB (there should be 250 on the list)?
