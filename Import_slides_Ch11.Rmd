# Review of R Variable Types

Some R data types:

* **logical**: `lgl`: logical contains only TRUE or FALSE values  

* **double**: `dbl`: for double-precision, or real numbers  

* **integer**: `int`  

* **character**:  `chr`:  character vectors, or strings    

* and others we'll focus on later like factors,  times and dates

# Demo: Import data sets 

## `heroes.csv`
## `cat-lovers.csv`

---

## Two Types of Data Sets 

* Tabular data: rows and columns
    + Sometimes tidy (for next time)

--

* Non-Tabular data  
    + Non-rectangular  
    + Linked data sets 
    + Mixed data types: variables are values, lists, other objects
    + Require careful handling

# Demo: Examples of less friendly data sets  

<!-- Duke basketball data and Anna R.'s Activity Roster Data, Math Department classes -->


---

# Common data set types and corresponding `read_` functions

* `read_csv()`
    + for reading comma delimted files
    
--

* `read_tsv()`
    + for reading tab delimited files
    + tabs between each data value

---

# Common data set types and corresponding `read_` functions


* `read_delim()`
    + flexible command for reading data with more general delimiters (e.g., `|`, `\`, etc.)
    + delimiter specified as part of the command

--

* `read_fwf()`
    + for reading fixed-width format files
    + requires column positions be specified but helper functions available

---
### Refer to Useful Arguments on the Cheat Sheet

* Typically assume csv files have variables names as first line followed by data starting on the second line

--

* Handling exceptions:  
    + No header row in input:    
      `read_csv(df, col_names = FALSE)`
    + Override header variable names:   
      `read_csv(df, col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))`  
    + Skip 5 lines before reading:   
      `read_csv(df, skip = 5)`   
    + Read a subset (first 100 lines):   
      `read_csv(df, n_max = 100)`  
    + Specify missing values:   
      `read_csv(df, na = c("-999", "."))`

## Suggested Process for Reading Challenging Data Sets  

1. First pass using: `df <- read_csv("file.csv")`  

2. Use `problems(df)` to diagnose problems 

3. Use helper functions  
    * Use a `col_` function to guide parsing  OR  
    * Read as character vectors and use `parse_` functions

# Parsing  

* What is **parsing**?  
  + The process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.

--

* Parser functions in R for parsing vectors:
    + For logicals:  `parse_logical()`  
    + For numbers: `parse_number()`, `parse_double()`, `parse_integer()`  
    + For dates and times: `parse_datetime()`, `parse_date()`, and `parse_time()`  
    + For characters: `parse_character()`: especially for using other character encodings
    
---

## **readr** Strategy for Parsing Files

* Guesses variable types based on first 1,000 rows (default)  

* Tests variable types in order:  

    1. Logicals  
    1. Numbers  
    1. Dates and Times  
    1. Leaves as a character if all of the above fail.  
    
* Performs well except when...  
    + First 1,000 rows don't tell the whole story  
    + Lots of missing values, NAs, especially non-standard missing values
    
* Use `problems()` or `guess_` functions to help diagnose what went wrong

---

## Troubleshooting Bad Reading

* Try `read_csv()` on the original CSV file  

* Use `problems()` to diagnose difficulties  

* Use `col_types` specifications to override incorrect guesses  

* Proceed iteratively column by column 

* For major problems, go extreme:  
    + Read into a character vector of lines with `read_lines()`
    + **More extreme**: Read into one long character string using `read_file()`


Note: Process is similar for other file formats

---

# Using R `guess_xyz()` functions  

* Use `guess_parser()` to understand why R identifies a variable as a certain type. 

* Can be useful in editing data or overriding default `col_type()` specifications in, say,  `read_csv()`

---

## Writing files  

* Writing to text files:  
    + `write_csv()` or `write_tsv()`  OR 
    + `write_excel_csv()` for writing to a CSV for use in Excel (if you have to)

--

* Writing to R binary format 
    + `write_rds()` for reliably writing and re-reading interim results (`read_rds()`)
