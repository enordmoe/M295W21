# Review from Last Time

1. Compare `filter()` and `select()`?

    + `filter(df, condition1, condition2)`
    
    + `select(df, condition1, condition2)`

2. Compare `arrange()` and `select()`   

    + How are they different? similar?

## Review: A Grammar for Data Wrangling  

While the object is always *data*, R4DS identifies a grammar for data wrangling that uses five *verbs*  :  

* `filter()`: picks observations by their values  

* `select()`: picks variables by their names  

* `arrange()`: reorders rows 

* `mutate()`: creates new variables from existing variables  

* `summarise()`: collapses many values down to a single summary   

$\Rightarrow$ used with the `group_by()` function to operate group-by-group



---

## Connect data wrangling commands  with the Pipe

.pull-left[
* The `%>%` operator in Tidyverse functions is called the pipe operator.   

* "Pipe" the output of the previous line to the next line  

* Pronounce the pipe `%>%` as: "and then"

* When combined with **ggplot** functions, be sure to use `+` for  layers of plots.
]
.pull-right[

```{r, out.width ="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/logo.png')
```
]

## Review: How does a pipe work?

* Think of code using the pipe as a sequence of actions:
    + Find key, unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.  
--

* *Expressed* as a set of nested functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

--

* Written code using pipes is easier to read:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

# Fuel Economy Data: `vehicles`  

`vehicles` data is included in the **fueleconomy** R package:  

* Fuel economy data from the EPA, 1985-2015.

* 33,442 observations and 12 variables  

* Includes common and uncommon vehicles

---

## The Data Set

```{r}
library(fueleconomy)
vehicles
```


---

##  Variables 

```{r"}
glimpse(vehicles)
```



---

## Filter for multiple conditions

```{r}
filter(vehicles, make == "Ford", model == "Mustang", year == 2013)
```



---

## Use Pipe to String Commands to Select Variables 

* Note that the data set is passed as the  implied first argument to `filter()` and `select`

```{r}
vehicles %>%
  filter(make == "Ford", model == "Mustang", year == 2013) %>%
  select(trans, cty, hwy) #<<
```



---

## Combine the pipe with `distinct()` to filter for unique rows 

```{r}
vehicles %>% 
  select(make, model) %>% 
  distinct() %>% #<<
  arrange(make, model)
```



---

# `summarise()` 

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/summarise.png')
```

.footnote[
Source: Data Transformation with `dplyr`: CHEAT SHEET
]

---

# Summarise the whole dataset  

```{r}
vehicles %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), med_cty = median(cty))
```

* Sometimes useful but other times could be very misleading  

* Subgroup analysis is more common


---

## `summarise()` and `group_by()`  

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/group_by.png')
```

.footnote[
Source: Data Transformation with `dplyr`: CHEAT SHEET
]


---

## Use `group_by()` to use `summarise()` with subgroups

.scroll-box-12[

```{r}
vehicles %>% 
  group_by(make) %>% 
  summarise(med_cty = median(cty), ncases = n()) #<<
```
]

.footnote[
Source: Data Transformation with **dplyr**: CHEAT SHEET
]
---

## But notice `group_by()` does little by itself
.scroll-box-16[
```{r}
vehicles %>% 
  group_by(make)
```

]

---

## Facts about `summarise()` 

* Displays results for `group_by()` groups in ascending order  

* Can be used with many functions and variations (see the Data Transformations Cheat sheet)  

    + Functions: `mean()`, `median()`, `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `sd()`, `IQR()`, etc.

    + Variations: `count()`, `tally()`, `summarise_all()`  
    

---

## Can be combined with other verbs using the pipe operator

.scroll-box-16[
```{r}
vehicles %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  group_by(make, model) %>% 
  summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_hwy)) %>% 
  ungroup() #<<
```
]

* Note use of `ungroup()`; try taking it out and see what happens? What do you think it's doing?


---

## Combine with `ggplot()`: Example 1 

```{r fig.height=4,fig.width=9}
vehicles %>%
  filter(make %in% c("Chevrolet", "Ford", "Toyota")) %>%
  group_by(make, year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_hwy, color = make)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Trend in Highway Mileage for Three Makes of Vehicles")
```

---

## Combine with `ggplot()`: Example 2 

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width=9, tidy = TRUE}
vehicles %>%
  filter(make %in% c("Chevrolet", "Ford", "Toyota"), year %in% c(2000, 2005, 2010)) %>%
  group_by(make, year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = make, y = avg_hwy, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) + 
  labs(title = "Average Highway Mileage by Make and Year", x = "", y = "MPG")
```


---

### Combine with `ggplot()`: Example 3 

```{r,  fig.height = 3, fig.width=9}
# A peak ahead introducing boxplots  
vehicles %>%
  group_by(make, year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_hwy = mean(hwy), n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = avg_hwy, fill= factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1985, 2015, 5)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = FALSE) + # suppress the legend 
  labs(x = "", y = "MPG", title = "Average Highway Mileage Variation Across Models and Time")
```
