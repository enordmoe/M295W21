# Outline

* Problems with dates and times  

* Parsing functions

* Intervals, periods, and durations  

---

# Factors Review

* Be careful about piping with factors. Why?

--

* What is the difference between `fct_count()` and `fct_unique()`?

--

* Compare and contrast `fct_infreq()` and `fct_reorder()`?

--

* Income is recorded in 20 narrow categories but I want to regroup to have just 4 categories. 
What `fct_xxx()` function should I use?

--

* How do you tell R to drop empty factor levels that do not occur in the data?   
    + How could this happen?

# Dates and Times are Challenging! 

* Many formats for writing times

* Leap years (and leap seconds!)

* Irregular months

* Time zones

* Daylight savings time (when is a day not a day?)

## Those tricky dates...

```{r}
parse_date("March 21st, 1992")
parse_date("12th of Jan, 2016")
```

## **lubridate** to the rescue

## **lubridate** parsing functions  

```{r}
mdy("March 21st, 1992")
dmy("12th of Jan, 2016")
ymd("1942Jan03")
mdy_hm("July041776 0930")
```

## Parsing functions

**lubridate** has a series of smart functions for parsing dates that do better than "parse_date()":

* Dates only:  
    + `ymd()`, `dmy()`, ...   
  
* Dates and times:  
    + `ymd_hms()`, `dmy_hms()`, `dmy_h()`, `ydm_h()`  
    
* See the Cheat Sheet and help files for more functions and details

# Difficult Questions about Dates and Times


* What day is one year after January 1, 2019?  

* What day is one month after February 15, 2019?  

* What time is 60 minutes after 1:30 am on March 10, 2019?

    + What is the last day of February?  

### Why are these question difficult?

---
## **lubridate** has several ways of dealing with these problems

* Answers depend on the starting point

```{r}
dmy("01-Jan-2019") + years(1)
dmy("01-Jan-2019") + days(365)
```

---
## **lubridate** has several ways of dealing with these problems

* Leap year gives different results
```{r}
dmy("01-Jan-2020") + years(1)
dmy("01-Jan-2020") + days(365)
```

---

## **lubridate** has several ways of dealing with these problems

```{r}
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") 
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") + minutes(60)
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") + dminutes(60)
```

---

## Timespans in **lubridate**  

* **Periods**: track changes in clock times ignoring irregularities
    + `minutes()`, `years()`, etc.
    + No `months()` because they're too irregular
--

* **Durations**: track the passage of physical time
    + `dminutes()`, `dhours()`, `dweeks()`, etc.
    + Underlying object stored in seconds

--

* **Intervals**: represent specific intervals of the timeline, 
bounded by start and end date-times

* Can be confusing $\Rightarrow$ see **lubridate** Cheat Sheet for helpful examples

## Other useful functions: Rounding date-times  


```{r, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/rounding_dates.png')
